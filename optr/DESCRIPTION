Description: The optR provides an option to solve the linear system
    using numeric computation approach. The current packages supports Gauss
    Elimination, LU decomposition, Gauss-Sideil, CGM and Cholesky methods to
    solve equations having relationships of Ax=b form. The package can be used
    to build linear and non-linear models by defining them in linear system.
